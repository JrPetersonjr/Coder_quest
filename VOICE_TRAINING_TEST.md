# 🎤 VOICE TRAINING TEST SCRIPT

## Testing the enhanced /DEV33 voice training system

This script demonstrates how the system works when you say:
"/DEV33 train an NPC female companion who sound like lara croft and billie eilish mixed their voices"

## Expected Workflow:

1. **Authentication**: `/DEV33 : hotdogwater`
   - System unlocks developer mode
   - AI Development Assistant activated

2. **Voice Training Request**: `/DEV33 train an NPC female companion who sound like lara croft and billie eilish mixed their voices`
   
3. **AI Analysis**:
   - Detects voice training request
   - Extracts character: "female_companion"  
   - Identifies voice targets: ["Lara Croft", "Billie Eilish"]
   - Determines traits: ["confident", "intelligent"]

4. **Auto-Generated Training Links**:
   ```
   📺 Generated Training Sources:
      1. Lara Croft Voice Lines - Tomb Raider
         https://youtube.com/watch?v=lara_croft_voice_compilation
      2. Billie Eilish Interview - Natural Speaking Voice
         https://youtube.com/watch?v=billie_eilish_interview
   ```

5. **Automatic Training**:
   - Auto-trains with primary source (Lara Croft)
   - Creates voice profile blending characteristics
   - Tests the trained voice

6. **Voice Test Results**:
   ```
   🎤 === FEMALE_COMPANION VOICE TEST ===
   [Voice: Pitch +2%, Speed 1.1x, confident/adventurous]
   Greetings, I am your companion.
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
   🎭 Personality: confident, intelligent
   💬 Voice synthesis would play here with trained characteristics
   ```

## Voice Mixing Logic:

**Lara Croft Characteristics**:
- Pitch: Slightly elevated (confident female)
- Tone: Adventurous, determined
- Accent: British/refined
- Speed: Quick, decisive

**Billie Eilish Characteristics**:
- Pitch: Lower, breathy
- Tone: Intimate, contemporary
- Style: Whispered, soft
- Speed: Relaxed, measured

**Combined Result**:
- Pitch: Balanced (slight elevation from Lara, softened by Billie)
- Tone: Confident but intimate
- Style: Adventurous yet approachable
- Speed: Moderate, engaging

## Test Commands:

1. `/DEV33 : hotdogwater` (unlock)
2. `/DEV33 train an NPC female companion who sound like lara croft and billie eilish mixed their voices`
3. `voice-test female_companion Hello there, ready for an adventure?`
4. `voice-list` (see all trained voices)

## Additional Examples:

**Wise Wizard**:
`/DEV33 train a wizard who sounds like gandalf and morgan freeman combined`

**Mysterious Oracle**:  
`/DEV33 create an oracle character with a voice like benedict cumberbatch mixed with ethereal whispers`

**Action Hero**:
`/DEV33 train a guard who sounds like chris evans mixed with commanding military tone`
