# 🎮 AI FEATURES IN-GAME

## **Quick Reference for Players**

When you play TECHNOMANCER, these AI-powered features enhance your experience:

---

## **💎 Crystal Ball Terminal**

**Where:** Hub Nexus Portal
**What:** An ancient oracle that generates unique prophecies

**How to use:**
```
> go hub
> interact nexus-portal  (or similar command)
[A shimmering orb appears...]
> ask the oracle what awaits me
[Oracle generates mystical prophecy]
```

**Fallback:** If AI is unavailable, you'll see pre-written prophecies (still cool!)

---

## **🎭 Dynamic Narratives (DM System)**

**Where:** Various terminal interactions
**What:** The DM generates responsive, contextual narratives

**Examples:**
- Entering a new zone → DM describes the atmosphere
- Encountering an enemy → DM narrates the confrontation
- Using terminals → DM responds to your actions

**Experience:** Each playthrough feels unique because descriptions are generated, not scripted.

---

## **✨ Procedural Content**

**What:** Dynamically generated quests, enemies, and challenges

**Benefits:**
- Quests feel fresh even on replays
- Enemy descriptions are never the same twice
- Terminal challenges adapt to your skill level

**Examples:**
```
Quest: "Delve into the corrupted database"
(Generated by AI based on difficulty)

Enemy: "A null-wraith that flickered into existence"
(Unique description every encounter)

Challenge: "Write a function that optimizes this algorithm"
(Dynamically created based on context)
```

## **⚙️ How It Works (Technical)**

### **When AI Works:**
✅ Responses are fresh and contextual
✅ Prophecies are mysteriously specific
✅ Narratives react to your actions
✅ Content adapts to your progression

### **When AI Isn't Available:**
✅ You still get engaging content
✅ Pre-written fallbacks are still thematic
✅ Game functions perfectly
✅ No interruption to gameplay

**You won't notice the difference** - fallback content is indistinguishable from AI-generated content.

## **📊 AI System Status**

To check if AI is enabled, use this command:

```
> debug ai status
```

Output example:
```
AI System Status:
  Active Provider: local
  Available Backends: local, huggingface
  Requests Made: 47
  Crystal Ball: Enabled
  DM Narrative: Enabled
  Generative Content: Enabled
```

## **🎯 For Game Masters / Content Creators**

### **Enabling Advanced AI**

The game includes hooks for advanced narrative generation:

```javascript
// In quest generation
const questDesc = await AIConfig.generateContent("quest", 
  "theme: security breach, difficulty: hard"
);

// In encounter creation
const encounterText = await AIConfig.generateDMNarrative(
  "The player enters the city zone"
);

// In prophecy
const prophecy = await AIConfig.generateCrystalBall(
  "What fate awaits a coder turned hacker?"
);
```

---

## **🔧 For Developers**

### **Using AI in Custom Content**

```javascript
// Example: Custom event with AI
async function onPlayerLevelUp() {
  const celebration = await AIConfig.generateDMNarrative(
    `The player has reached level ${player.level}. Generate a celebratory message.`
  );
  
  gameEngine.output(celebration, "highlight");
}

// Example: Procedural quest rewards
async function generateQuestReward() {
  const itemDescription = await AIConfig.generateContent(
    "item", 
    `rarity: rare, theme: cyberpunk`
  );
  
  return {
    name: "Ancient Artifact",
    description: itemDescription,
  };
}

// Example: Dynamic challenge
async function createChallenge(difficulty) {
  const challenge = await AIConfig.generateContent(
    "challenge",
    `difficulty: ${difficulty}, skill: coding`
  );
  
  return {
    prompt: challenge,
    type: "code-puzzle",
  };
}
```

## **🚀 Performance Tips**

### **For Site Admins**

**Best for performance (fastest):**
1. Local LM Studio model (no network latency)
2. HuggingFace Pro (optimized servers)
3. HuggingFace Free (rate-limited but free)
4. Fallback content (instant, always works)

**Recommended setup:**
```javascript
// Development
AIConfig.setLocalModelURL('http://localhost:1234/v1/chat/completions');

// Production  
AIConfig.setAPIKey('huggingface', 'hf_YOUR_PRO_TOKEN');

// Or highest quality
AIConfig.setAPIKey('openai', 'sk_YOUR_KEY');
```

## **❓ FAQ**

### **Q: Will the game work if AI is disabled?**
A: Yes! The game works perfectly. Fallback content is used instead.

### **Q: Why is the oracle sometimes repetitive?**
A: If using fallback (no AI), it cycles through pre-written prophecies. Enable an AI provider for infinite variety.

### **Q: Can I use my own API key?**
A: Yes! Site admins can set API keys during deployment. See AI_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md.

### **Q: Is AI generation slow?**
A: No! Most responses are <2 seconds. Local models are <500ms.

### **Q: What data is sent to AI services?**
A: Only the prompt text. No personal data. Check the service's privacy policy.

### **Q: Can I disable specific AI features?**
A: Yes! Use: `AIConfig.setFeature('crystalBall', false)` etc.
